14 == Users and Credentials
15 
16 A TigerGraph user is a database-level security principal on the TigerGraph platform. When user authentication is enabled, only clients who can provide credentials that identify themselves as a user can interact with the TigerGraph database.
17 
18 The TigerGraph platform offers two options for credentials:
19 
20 . A username-password pair
21 . A token - a unique 32-character string used for REST{pp} requests, with an expiration date.
