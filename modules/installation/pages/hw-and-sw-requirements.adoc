5 TigerGraph can be used for different scopes and the system requirements largely depend on the use of the software. This page provides a good reference, but actual hardware requirements will vary based on your data size and workload.

31 Comments:
32 
33 * The TigerGraph system is optimized to take advantage of multiple cores.
34 * Performance is optimal when the memory is large enough to store the full graph and to perform computations.
35 
36 == Certified Operating Systems
37 
38 The TigerGraph Software Suite is built on 64-bit Linux. It can run on a variety of Linux 64-bit distributions. The software has been tested on the operating systems listed below:
39

82 |===
83 
84 When a range of versions is given, it means that the software has been tested on the oldest and newest versions. We continually evaluate the operating systems on the market and work to update our set of supported operating systems as needed.  The TigerGraph installer will install its own copies of Java JDK and GCC, accessible only to the TigerGraph user account, to avoid interfering with any other applications on the same server.
85 
86 == Prerequisite Software
87 
88 === Shell
89 
90 Please use a bash shell for the installation process.
91 
92 === Utilities
93 
94 Before offline installation, the TigerGraph system needs a few basic software packages to be present:
95 
96 * `tar`
97 * `curl`
98 * `crontab`
99 * `ip`
100 * `ssh`/`sshd` (Only required for cluster installation)
101 * `more`
102 * `netstat`
103 * `sshpass`
104  ** if you intend to use password login method (P method) instead of ssh key login method (K method) to install the TigerGraph platform.
105 
106 If they are not present, contact your system administrator to have them installed on your target system. For example, they can be installed with one of the following commands.
107 
108 [source,bash]
109 ----
110 # Centos or RedHat:
111 sudo yum install tar curl cronie iproute util-linux-ng net-tools coreutils openssh-clients openssh-server sshpass
112 
113 # Ubuntu or Debian (Except Ver 18.04):
114 sudo apt install tar curl cron iproute util-linux net-tools coreutils openssh-client openssh-server sshpass
115 
116 # Ubuntu or Debian (Ver. 18.04):
117 sudo apt install tar curl cron iproute2 util-linux net-tools coreutils openssh-client openssh-server sshpass
118 ----
119 
120 === NTP
121 
122 If you are running TigerGraph on a multi-node cluster, you *must* install, configure and run the NTP (Network Time Protocol) daemon service. This service will synchronize system time among all cluster nodes.
123 
124 === Firewall
125 
126 If you are running TigerGraph on a multi-node cluster, you *must* configure the iptables/firewall rules to make all TCP ports open among all cluster nodes.
127 
128 === Browser
129 
130 In an on-premises installation, the system is fully functional without a web browser. To run the optional browser-based TigerGraph GraphStudio User Interface or Admin Portal, you need an appropriate browser:
131 
132 |===
133 | Browser | Chrome | Safari | Firefox | Opera | Edge | Internet Explorer
134 
135 | Supported version
136 | 54.0+
137 | 11.1+
138 | 59.0+
139 | 52.0+
140 | 80.0+
141 | 10+
