6 This guide describes how to install the TigerGraph platform either as a single node or as a multi-node cluster, interactively or non-interactively.
7 
8 NOTE: If you signed up for the Enterprise Free license, you also have access to the TigerGraph platform as a Docker image or a virtual machine (VirtualBox) image.
9 Follow the instructions in xref:cloud:start:getting-started.adoc[Getting started] to start up TigerGraph in a Docker container or with VirtualBox.

17 == Preparation
18 
19 Before you can install the TigerGraph system, you need the following:
20 
21 * One or more machines that meet the minimum xref:hw-and-sw-requirements.adoc[_Hardware and Software Requirements_].
22 * A sudo user with the same username and login credential on every machine.
23  ** If sudo privilege is not available, please contact TigerGraph support for workarounds.
24 * A license key provided by TigerGraph (not applicable to Enterprise Free)
25 * A TigerGraph system package
26  ** If you do not yet have a TigerGraph system package, you can request one at the following address: https://www.tigergraph.com/get-tigergraph/
27 * If you are installing a cluster, ensure that every machine has the same SSH port and the port stays open during installation
28 
29 == *Installation*
30 
31 TigerGraph's installation script support both single-node and cluster installation, and the user can choose to install either interactively and non-interactively.
32 
33 === Interactive installation
34 
35 The following describes the procedure to install TigerGraph on Linux interactively. The filename of your package may vary, depending on the product edition and version. For the examples here, we use the filename `tigergraph-<version>.tar.gz`, which should be replaced by the actual filename of your package.
36 
37 ==== *Step 1*: Extract the package
38 
39 Extract the package by running the following command. A folder named `tigergraph-<version>-offline` __**__will be created.
40 
41 
42 [tabs]
43 ====
44 Title A::

47 [,bash]
48 ----
49 $ tar -xzf tigergraph-<version>.tar.gz

54 --
55 [,bash]
56 ----
57 $ gadmin status
58 ----
59 --
60 ====
61 
62 ==== *Step 2*:  Run installation script
63 
64 Navigate to the `tigergraph-<version>-offline` folder and run script `install.sh`  with the following commands:
65 
66 .Run the installation script
67 [source,bash]
68 ----
69 $ cd tigergraph-<version>-offline
70 
71 # to install enterprise license
72 $ sudo ./install.sh
73 
74 # For non-interactive installations, please see the non-interactive mode section.
75 ----
76 
77 
78 The installer will ask for the following information, for which you may choose to hit Enter to skip and use the system default or enter a new value:
79 
80 * Your agreement to the License Terms and Conditions
81 * Your license key (not applicable for Enterprise Free)
82 * Username for the Linux user who will own and manage the TigerGraph platform
83  ** The installer creates a Linux user who is the only authorized user that can run `gadmin` commands to manage the TigerGraph Platform, and for whom this username is for
84 * Password for the Linux user who will own and manage the TigerGraph platform
85 * Path to where the installation folder will be
86 * Path to where the data folder will be
87 * Path to where the log folder will be
88 * Path to where the temp folder will be
89 * The SSH port for your machine
90 
91 To see what the default settings are, read the <<_installation_options>> section below.
92 
93 WARNING: Since license keys are long -- over 100 characters long. If you copy-and-paste the license key, be careful not to accidentally include an end-of-line character.
94 
95 
96 ==== *Step 3*: Configure cluster settings
97 
98 TigerGraph cluster configuration enables the graph database to be partitioned and distributed across multiple server nodes in a local network. After you have answered the questions described in the previous step, the installation script will ask for the following to complete cluster configuration:
99 
100 * The number of nodes in your cluster. Each node  will be given an alias following the input (`m1`, `m2`, `m3`, etc.)
101  ** If this is a single-node installation, enter `1`
102 * The IP address of each node
103 * Username and credentials information of the sudo user
104  ** Every machine in the cluster must have a sudo user with the same username and password or SSH key.
105 * Permission to set NPT time synchronization
106 * Permission to set firewall rules among the cluster nodes
107 
108 
109 NOTE: In TigerGraph 3.x, the installation machine can be within or outside the cluster. If outside the cluster, the installation machine still needs to be a Linux machine.
110 
111 
112 After all the questions are answered, the script will proceed to installation. A screenshot of the interactive installation is shown below:
113 
114 image::image%20%2876%29.png[]
115 
116 ==== *Step 4*: Verify installation
117 
118 After installation is complete, you can switch to the Linux user who owns the platform (created in link:install.adoc#_step_2_run_installation_script[Step 2]) with the following command :
119 
120 [,bash]
121 ----
122 $ su <username>  # default username: tigergraph
123 ----
124 
125 At the prompt, enter the password that was set in Step 2.
126 
127 After switching to the correct user, you now have access to xref:gadmin:management-with-gadmin:adoc[`gadmin` commands]. Confirm successful installation by running `gadmin status`. If the system is installed correctly and the license is activated, the command should report that all services are up and ready. Since there is no graph data loaded yet, GSE __**__and GPE will show `"Warmup"`.

130 
131 === Non-interactive installation
132 
133 The following describes the procedure to install TigerGraph on Linux non-interactively.
134 
135 ==== *Step 1*: Extract the package
136 
137 Extract the package by running the following command. A folder named `tigergraph-<version>-offline` will be created.
138 
139 
140 .Extract for version X.Y.Z
141 [,bash]
142 ----
143 $ tar -xzf tigergraph-<version>.tar.gz
144 ----
145 
146 
147 ==== Step 2: Configure installation settings
148 
149 Navigate to the `tigergraph-<version>-offline` folder. Inside the folder, there is a file named `install_conf.json`. For non-interactive mode installation, the user must review and modify all the settings in the file _**_`install_conf.json` before running the installer.
150 
151 Below is an example of the `install_conf.json` file:

187 ----
188 
189 Here is a description of all the fields in the config file:
190 
191 * `"BasicConfig"`
192  ** `"TigerGraph"` : Information about the Linux user that will be created by the installer who owns and manages the TigerGraph platform.
193   *** `"Username"`: Username of the Linux user.
194   *** `"Password"`: Password of the Linux user.
195   *** `"SSHPort"`: Port number used to establish SSH connections.
196   *** `"PrivateKeyFile"` (optional):  Absolute path to a valid private key file. If left empty, TigerGraph will generate one named `tigergraph.rsa` automatically.
197   *** `"PublicKeyFile"`(optional): Absolute path to a valid public key file. If left empty, TigerGraph will generate one named `tigergraph.pub` automatically.
198  ** `"RootDir"`
199   *** `"AppRoot"`: Absolute path to where application folder will be.
200   *** ``"DataRoot``": Absolute path to where the data folder will be.
201   *** `"LogRoot"`: Absolute path to where the log folder will be.
202   *** `"TempRoot"`: Absolute path to where the temp folder will be.
203  ** `"License"`: Your TigerGraph license string.
204  ** `"Node List"`:  A JSON array of the nodes in the cluster. Each machine in the cluster is defined as a key-value pair, where the key is a machine alias (m1, m2, m3, etc) and the value is the IP address of the node.
205 * `"AdvancedConfig"`
206  ** `"ClusterConfig"`: Cluster configurations
207   *** `"LoginConfig"`: Login configurations
208    **** `"SudoUser"`: Username of the sudo user who will be used to execute the installation on all nodes.
209    **** `"Method"`: Authentication method for SSH. Enter `"P"` to use password authentication and `"K"` to use key-based authentication.
210    **** `"P"`: Password of the sudo user.
211    **** `"K"`: Absolute path to the SSH key to be used to authenticate the sudo user.
212   *** `"ReplicationFactor"`: xref:intro:continuous-availability-overview.adoc#_continuous_availability__definitions[Replication factor] of the cluster.
213    **** If you would like to enable the High Availability (HA) feature, please make sure you have at least 3 nodes in the cluster and set the replication factor to be greater than 1. For example, if your cluster has 6 nodes, you could set the replication factor to be 2 or 3. If you set the replication factor to be 2, then the partitioning factor will be  6 / 2 = 3.  Therefore, 3 nodes will be used for one copy of the data, and the other 3 nodes will be used as a replica copy of the data.
214    **** Ensure that the total number of nodes can be fully divided by the replication factor.  Otherwise, some nodes may not be utilized as parts of the HA cluster.
215 
216 ==== Step 3: Run install script with `-n` option
217 
218 Start the non-interactive installation process by running the `install.sh` script with the `-n` option:
219 
220 [,bash]
221 ----
222 $ sudo ./install.sh -n
223 ----
224 
225 === Installation options
226 
227 The following default settings will be applied if no parameters are specified:
228 
229 * The installer will create a Linux user with username `tigergraph` and with password `tigergraph`. This user will be the only user authorized to run `gadmin` commands to manage the TigerGraph platform and services.
230  ** If there is already a user named `tigergraph`, this user will be designated as the platform owner and no other user will be created.
231 * The default root directory for the installation would be `/home/tigergraph/tigergraph` ****with the App/Data/Log/Temp files within it : App Path : `/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app` ****Data Path :``/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/data`` ****Log Path :``/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log`` ****Temp Path :``/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/tmp``
232 * The root directory for the installation (referred to as `<tigerGraph_root_dir>`) is a folder called `tigergraph` __**__located in the tigergraph user's home directory, i.e., `/home/tigergraph/tigergraph`.
233 
234 The installation can be customized by running command-line options with the `install.sh` script:
235 
236 ==== Command-line options
237 
238 [,bash]
239 ----
240 # Command-line options for install.sh
241 Usage:
242 ./install.sh [-n] [-u <user>] [-p <password>] [-r <tigergraph_root_dir>] [-l <license_key>] [-F] [-N]
243 ./install.sh -h
244 Options:
245   -h  --  Show help information
246   -u  --  Username of Linux user to create [default: tigergraph]
247   -p  --  Password of Linux user to create [default: tigergraph]
248   -l  --  TigerGraph license key
249   -n  --  Non-interactive option: suppress prompts, and install
250           using default config
251   -F  --  Set iptables (firewall) rules to open TCP ports among cluster nodes
252   -N  --  Set NTP system time synchronization among cluster nodes
253 
254 [NOTE    ]: Using option '-n' will non-interactively install the platform
255             on single node or cluster with all configurations from
256             config file "install_config.json". In this case, the config
257             file should be modified before installation.
258 
259 [WARNING ]: Installer will fail if any option (except -F and -N)
260             is provided with option '-n' at the same time.
