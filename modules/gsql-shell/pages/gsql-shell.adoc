1 = The GSQL Shell
2 
3 The GSQL shell is a fully functional Java environment for interacting with the TigerGraph database. 
4 It is one of the primary ways to interact with the TigerGraph database and is included in a standard TigerGraph installation. 
5 
6 == Launch the shell
7 As the TigerGraph Linux user, type `gsql` into the bash terminal to start a GSQL shell session:
8 
9 [source,bash]
10 ----
11 $ gsql
12 ----
13 
14 If authentication is enabled, you will need to provide credentials in order to launch the shell. 
15 
16 == Run a GSQL script
17 You don't always need to enter the interactive shell in order to run a GSQL command. To run a GSQL command non-interactively, run the command `gsql` followed by the GSQL commands you want to run in quotes:
18 
19 [source,bash]
20 ----
21 $ gsql 'ls'
22 ----
23 
24 == Change scope
25 In the GSQL shell, you can run commands on a global scope or on a local scope. 
26 When you start a GSQL session, you are in the global scope.
27 To change to the local scope of a graph, run the `USE GRAPH` command.
28 
29 [source,GSQL]
30 ----
31 GSQL > USE GRAPH social
32 Using graph 'social'
33 ----
34 
35 To switch back to the global scope, run `USE GLOBAL`. 
36 
37 [source,GSQL]
38 ----
39 GSQL > USE GLOBAL
40 ----
41 
42 Operating on different scopes will require different privileges.
