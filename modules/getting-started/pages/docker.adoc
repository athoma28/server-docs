24 == 1. Install Docker Desktop
25 
26 Follow the steps below to install Docker Desktop on your machine and configure it with sufficient resources for TigerGraph:
27 
28 . Install Docker on your OS:
29  ** To install Docker for Mac OS, follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU8HUVlJTEY
30  ** To install Docker for Linux, follow these instructions:
31   *** Centos: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/
32   *** Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
33  ** To install Docker for Windows OS, follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymlWt1MqURY
34 . Configure Docker Desktop with sufficient resources:
35  ** Recommended: 4 cores and 16GB memory
36  ** Minimum: 2 cores and 10GB memory
37  ** Click the Docker Desktop icon, click *Preferences* >> *Resources*, drag the CPU and Memory sliders to the desired configuration, save and restart Docker Desktop
38 
39 == 2. Prepare a Shared Folder on Host OS to be shared with Docker Container
40 
41 Open a shell on your host machine and create or select a directory for sharing data between your host machine and docker container. Grant read+write+execute permission to the folder. For example, to create a folder called data in Linux:
42 
43 [,text]
44 ----
45     $ mkdir data
46     $ chmod 777 data
47 ----
48 
49 You can mount (map) the data folder to a folder under the docker container, which allows you to share files between your host OS and Docker OS.
50 
51 For example, if you mount the host OS folder `~/data` to the docker folder `/home/tigergraph/mydata`,  then anything you put on `~/data` will be visible in the docker container under `/home/tigergraph/mydata`, and vice versa.
52 
53 == 3. Run TigerGraph Docker image as a daemon
54 
55 Run the following command to pull the TigerGraph docker image, bind ports, map a shared data folder, and start a container from the image. Note: this command is very long; please make sure you copy the whole command by dragging the scroll bar to the end:
56 
57 [,text]
58 ----
59 $ docker run -d -p 14022:22 -p 9000:9000 -p 14240:14240 --name tigergraph --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 -v ~/data:/home/tigergraph/mydata -t docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph:latest
60 ----
61 
62 * Here is a breakdown of the options and arguments in the command:
63  ** `-d`: make the container run in the background.
64  ** `-p`: map docker 22 port to host OS 14022 port, 9000 port to host OS 9000 port, 14240 port to host OS 14240 port.
65  ** `--name`: name the container tigergraph.
66  ** `--ulimit`: set the `ulimit` (the number of open file descriptors per process) to 1 million.
67  ** `-v`: mount the host OS `~/data` folder to the docker `/home/tigergraph/mydata` folder using the -v option. If you are using Windows, change the above ~/data to something using windows file system convention, e.g. `c:\data`
68  ** `-t`: allocate a pseudo-TTY
69  ** `docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph:latest`:  download the latest docker image from the TigerGraph docker registry URL docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph.
70 
71 [NOTE]
72 ====
73 Replace "latest" with a specific version number if a dedicated version of TigerGraph is to be used. E.g., if you want to get the 3.0.5 version, the URL should be:
74 
75 `docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph:3.0.5`
76 
77 To use the legacy developer editions, use:
78 
79 `docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-dev`
80 ====
81 
82 If you use Windows and have disk drive permission issues with the above command,  try the following command instead (this command does not map the shared folder on your host machine to your container) :
83 
84 [,text]
85 ----
86 $ docker run -d -p 14022:22 -p 9000:9000 -p 14240:14240 --name tigergraph --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 -t docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph:latest
87 ----
88 
89 == 4. Use SSH to connect to your container
90 
91 After launching the container, you can use SSH to connect to your container:
92 
93 . Verify that the container is running. You should see a row that describes the running container after running the command below:
94 +
95 [,text]
96 ----
97 $ docker ps | grep tigergraph
98 ----
99 
100 . Use ssh to open a shell to the container. At the prompt, enter `tigergraph`  as the password. Note that we have mapped the host 14022 port to the container's 22 port (the ssh default port), so on the host we use ssh to connect to port 14022.
101 +
102 [,text]
103 ----
104 $ ssh -p 14022 tigergraph@localhost
105 ----
106 
107 == 5. Start TigerGraph
108 
109 . After connecting to the container via ssh, inside the container, start all TigerGraph services with the following command (which may take up to one minute):
110 +
111 [,text]
112 ----
113 $ gadmin start all
114 ----
115 
116 . Run the `gsql` command as shown below to start the GSQL shell. If you are new to TigerGraph, you can run the xref:gsql-ref:tutorials:gsql-101/README.adoc[GSQL 101] tutorial now.
117 +
118 [,text]
119 ----
120 $ gsql
121 GSQL >
122 ----
123 
124 . Start GraphStudio, TigerGraph's visual IDE, by visiting `+http://localhost:14240+`
125 +
126 in a browser on your laptop (host OS).
127 
128 == Operation Commands Cheat Sheet
129 
130 * After you start Docker Desktop, use the commands below to stop and restart the container:
131 +
132 [,text]
133 ----
134   $ docker container stop tigergraph
135   $ docker container start tigergraph
136 ----
137 
138 * Start the TigerGraph service within the container:
139 +
140 [,text]
141 ----
142   $ gadmin start all
143   $ gadmin stop  all
144 ----
145 
146 * ssh to the container. Note: if localhost is not recognized, remove the localhost entry from ~/.ssh/known_hosts
147 +
148 [,text]
149 ----
150   $ sed -i.bak '/localhost/d' ~/.ssh/known_hosts
151   $ ssh -p 14022 tigergraph@localhost
152 ----
153 +
154 ____
155 Linux users can access the container through its ip address directly:
156 ____
157 +
158 [,text]
159 ----
160   $ docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' tigergraph
161   $vssh tigergraph@<container_ip_address>
162 ----
163 
164 * Default user: `tigergraph`
165 * Default password: `tigergraph`
166 * After running `gadmin start`, you can go to GraphStudio. Open a browser on your laptop (host OS) and access GraphStudio at the following URL:
167 +
168 [,text]
169 ----
170   http://localhost:14240
171 ----
172 
173 * Check the version of GSQL:
174 +
175 [,text]
176 ----
177 $ gsql version
178 ----
