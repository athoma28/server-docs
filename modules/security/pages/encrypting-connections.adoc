1 = Encrypting Connections
2 
3 TigerGraph supports secure data-in-flight communication, using SSL/TLS encryption protocol. This applies to any outward-facing channel, including GSQL clients, RESTPP endpoints, and the GraphStudio web interface. When SSL/TLS is enabled, HTTPS takes the place of HTTP for RESTPP and GraphStudio connections.

5 == Prerequisites
6 
7 You should have basic knowledge about how SSL works:
8 
9 . What the SSL certificate and key are used for
10 . That an SSL certificate is bound to a domain
11 . How an SSL certificate chain works
12 
13 A good primer on SSL is available to https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ssl_intro.html
14 
15 == Nginx-Based
16 
17 TigerGraph uses the Nginx web server, so SSL configuration makes use of some built-in support in Nginx.
18 
19 http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html
20 
21 == Step 1. Obtain an SSL Certificate
22 
23 The two main options for obtaining an SSL Certificate are to generate your own self-signed certificate or to purchase a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority. Regardless of which method you choose, your certificate should be chained to a trusted root certificate embedded in your browser. The options and details for producing a trusted SSL certificate are beyond the scope of this document. The focus of this document is how to configure your TigerGraph system to use the certificate to enable SSL.
24 
25 === Option 1: Using a Certificate From A Trusted Agent
26 
27 First, obtain an SSL certificate from a trusted agent of your choice. Certificate vendors will provide clear instructions for ordering a certificate and then for installing it on your system.
28 
29 Then you can configure the certificate with `gadmin config entry ssl`
30 
31 === Option 2: Create a Self-Signed Certificate
32 
33 There are multiple ways to create a self-signed certificate.  One example is shown below.
34 
35 [WARNING]
36 ====
37 For simplicity, the method below will use the root certificate directly as the HTTPS server certificate.  This method is satisfactory for testing but should not be used for a production system.
38 ====
39 
40 [NOTE]
41 ====
42 In the example below, the Common Name value should be your server hostname, since HTTPS certificates are bound to domain names.
43 ====

45 .Self-Signed Certificate generation example using openssl
46 
47 [source,bash]
48 ----
49 $ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ~/nginx-selfsigned.key -out ~/nginx-selfsigned.crt
50 
51 Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
52 .................................................................................................................................+++
53 ........+++
54 writing new private key to '/home/tigergraph/nginx-selfsigned.key'
55 -----
56 You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
57 into your certificate request.
58 What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
59 There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
60 For some fields there will be a default value,
61 If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
62 -----
63 Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
64 State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
65 Locality Name (eg, city) []:Redwood City
66 Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:TigerGraph
67 Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:GLE
68 Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []: my.ip.addr.num
69 Email Address []:engineer@tigergraph.com
70 ----
71 
72 
73 
74 === Change the Certificate Permission
75 
76 For security reasons, the certificates can only be used with permission 600 or less.
77 
78 [source,text]
79 ----
80 $ chmod 600 ~/nginx-selfsigned.*
81 ----
82 
83 == Step 2: Configure SSL with `gadmin`
84 
85 With the self-signed certificate successfully generated, you can configure it with `gadmin`, so that all the HTTP traffic will be protected with SSL.
86 
87 [NOTE]
88 ====
89 TigerGraph's SSL only accepts PEM-encoded certificates. If you have a certificate encoded in other formats (e.g. DER), you need to https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-converter.html[convert it to a PEM-encoded certificate] first.
90 ====
91 
92 [source,bash]
93 ----
94 $ gadmin config entry ssl
95 
96 â€‹Nginx.SSL.Enable [ false ]: Enable SSL connection for all HTTP requests
97 New: true
98 
99 Nginx.SSL.Key [ <masked> ]: Private key for SSL
100 New: @privateKey_file_path
101 
102 Nginx.SSL.Cert [ <masked> ]: Public certificate for SSL
103 New: @ssl_cert_path
104 
105 # This config (Nginx.ProxySSLVerify) was removed in v3.1.1

107 New: true

109 
110 After saving the settings, apply the configuration settings.

116 [ Info] Successfully applied configuration change. Please restart services to make it effective immediately.

118 
119 Then restart the following services: `gsql`, `nginx`, `ts3`, and `gui`.
120 
121 [source,text]
122 ----
123 $ gadmin restart gsql nginx gui ts3 -y
124 ----
125 
126 == Testing Your SSL Connection
127 
128 Now you may test the connection.
129 
130 A direct curl request to the server will fail due to certificate verification failure:
131 
132 [source,text]
133 ----
134 $ curl https://localhost:14240
135 
136 curl: (60) server certificate verification failed. CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt CRLfile: none
137 More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
138 
139 curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
140 of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
141 bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
142 using the --cacert option.
143 
144 If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
145 the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
146 problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
147 not match the domain name in the URL).
148 
149 If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
150 the -k (or --insecure) option.
151 ----
152 
153 [WARNING]
154 ====
155 In v1.2, the default TCP/IP port for Nginx has changed from 44240 to 14240, to avoid possible port conflicts with Zookeeper.
156 ====
157 
158 You may use the -k option to turn off the verification, but it is unsafe and not recommended.
159 
160 To successfully make requests with curl, you will need to specify the certificate by using the `--cacert` parameter:
161 
162 [source,bash]
163 ----
164 $ curl --cacert /home/tigergraph/nginx-selfsigned.crt https://localhost:14240
